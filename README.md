## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me understand the importance of accessibility and responsiveness in web design. Some key things I learned:
- Semantic HTML: Using <main>, <footer>, and <button> with appropriate aria-labels improves screen reader accessibility.
- Hover and Active States: Adding visual cues to buttons enhances user experience.
- Media Queries: I implemented a responsive design using a @media rule for small screens


### Continued development

-Explore using JavaScript for dynamic features.
-Diving deeper into accessibility.
